    "#### **DATASET DESCRIPTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "The [NCEI/WDS Global Significant Volcanic Eruptions Database](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ngdc.mgg.hazards:G10147) is a very comprehensive collection of +600 volcanic eruptions dating from 4360 BC to the present. Due to the nature of this assignment, we will be dealing with relatively newer volcanoes (in which some are still obviously still older than anyone on Earth currently). Each eruption in the database is classified as significant if it meets one or more criteria, such as causing fatalities, incurring **damage on property** (**+$1 million**), reaching a **Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI)** of **6 or higher**, generating a tsunami, or being linked to a significant earthquake. The VEI is a scale that measures the explosiveness of volcanic eruptions, providing insight into the magnitude and potential consequences of the eruptions. The database includes detailed information on the location, type of volcano, last known eruption, VEI, casualties, property damage, and much more.\n",

    "#### **Objective of the Assignment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will proceed directly to exploring these volcanic datasets, with the aim of enhancing our proficiency in Pandas and SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your reference, the [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) will be an invaluable resource. Additionally, we have provided several helpful links to assist you throughout this process. Please proceed with caution to avoid any potential pitf\n",
